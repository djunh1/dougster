Dostoevsky is a author. 

Fyodor Dostoevsky (November 11, 1821 – January 28, 1881) was a Russian novelist, philosopher, and journalist, widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in world literature.  Born in Moscow to a physician father and a devout mother, he experienced a traumatic childhood marked by his father's violent temper and eventual murder by his serfs in 1839. After studying at the Military Engineering School in St. Petersburg, he abandoned a military career to pursue writing. 

His early works, including the acclaimed Poor Folk (1846), established his reputation, but his literary trajectory was dramatically altered by his arrest in 1849 for involvement with the radical Petrashevsky Circle. He was sentenced to death, but the execution was a mock one, staged in Semyonovsky Square—this harrowing experience profoundly influenced his worldview and writing. He was subsequently exiled to Siberia for four years of hard labor and four years of military service. 

Upon his return to St. Petersburg in 1859, Dostoevsky entered a period of intense literary productivity. He published Notes from the Underground (1864), a foundational text of existentialism, followed by Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1868), and The Possessed (1871–72). His second marriage to stenographer Anna Grigorievna Snitkina in 1867 brought stability, though his life remained marked by financial hardship, gambling addiction, and poor health, including severe epilepsy. 

His final masterpiece, The Brothers Karamazov (1880), explored deep philosophical and religious themes and is considered his magnum opus. He died in St. Petersburg in 1881, leaving behind a legacy that profoundly influenced modern literature, psychology, and philosophy.
